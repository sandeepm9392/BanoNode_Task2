# Run the file by the command 
# npm run dev
it will start in localhost:8000

add your mongoDB string gor data collection and retrieval
# choose API platform of your choice to test the API calls 

here we have mostly used

localhost:8000/api/posts - for posting a post
localhost:8000/api/posts/:id - for update-put ,delete-Delete
localhost:8000/api/posts/like/:id for like-put method
localhost:8000/api/posts/comment/:id for comment-put method

 up on deletion of the post all likes and commnets will be long gone with it
